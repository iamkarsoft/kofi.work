### WEEK 1
<br>

#### HTML5 & CSS3

Bootcamp starts by solidifying your existing knowledge of the fundamentals of web
development. In your first week, through a mix of lessons and hands-on exercises,
you’ll begin to master HTML & CSS. You’ll learn to use an advanced code editor to
structure documents with HTML and create a visual layout with CSS. In this week,
you’ll also master using browser development tools to experiment and diagnose
issues, and be introduced to responsive design techniques.

### WEEK 2
<br>

#### Advanced HTML & CSS
<br>
<br>
This week, we’ll continue solidifying your HTML & CSS knowledge. We’ll explore
advanced HTML & CSS concepts and begin integrating UI elements to your
websites using JavaScript. In this week, you’ll begin your practice of working on small teams of developers to create style guides and project conventions. You’ll also
start learning how to code review, and practice giving and receiving peer feedback,
both important industry practices for web developers.
<br>

### WEEK 3
<br>

#### Intro to Programming with JavaScript
<br>

This week, we’ll dive into JavaScript. JavaScript is the programming language at
the core of our Bootcamp, and will give you the power to add more functionality
and interactivity to your code. We’ll start by introducing you to programming
fundamentals such as objects, functions, and arrays. We’ll also use Git and GitHub to
learn version control, to contribute to a code base, and to prepare your projects to
be live online.
<br>
<br>

### WEEK 4
<br>
<br>

#### JavaScript & APIs
<br>
This week, we’ll dive deeper into JavaScript. You’ll work collaboratively with other
students and begin working with APIs to access data for use in your applications.
We’ll explore API documentation, practice working with API data, and use the
lessons learned so far to create a web application that demonstrates working with
data, DOM manipulation, error handling, and UI design.
<br>

### WEEK 5
<br>
<br>

#### Advanced JavaScript
<br>
In our second full week tackling JavaScript, you’ll learn about Ajax and JSON,
and continue working with APIs. We’ll cover how to use asynchronous events in
JavaScript and you’ll be introduced to data persistence and storage with Firebase.
We’ll also explore class-based programming and objects, and advanced JavaScript
topics such as scope, execution context, destructuring, and mutability.
<br>

### WEEK 6
<br>
<br>

#### JavaScript Web Applications & React
<br>
This week we’ll start exploring React, a popular JavaScript library. You’ll learn how
to use React to create modular and reusable interfaces for your web applications.
This week we’ll also dive further into Firebase, our preferred backend-as-a-service
(BaaS) system that allows us to create rich web applications with persistent data (for
example, using Firebase allows us to build apps that can support user sign in).
<br>

### WEEK 7
<br>
<br>

#### React Continued
<br>
Building on last week’s learning, you’ll continue working on your introductory
React projects and begin to explore more features available in React. You will be
introduced to an agency style project where you will create a multi-page web
application with a team of your peers. This will give you the opportunity to learn from
each other, deploy production ready applications, and solidify your understanding
of React concepts taught.
<br>

### WEEK 8
<br>

#### Putting It All Together
<br>
<br>
This week we’ll put the “project” in project-based learning. You’ll focus on continuing
your large group project, using in-class work time to build your complex, showstopping
app that will wow potential employers. You’ll also dive deeper into
preparing for the job search with our Career Services Team!
<br>


## Full-stack bootcamp
<br>
<br>
- [ ] &nbsp;HTTP Requests & methods
- [ ] &nbsp;Client & server communication
- [ ] &nbsp;API implementation using server-side
- [ ] &nbsp;Data persistence and document-oriented database systems
- [ ] &nbsp;End-user and client-server authentication techniques

### MODULE 1


<br>

#### Modern JavaScript Techniques & React
<br>
<br>
Welcome to Full-Stack Development! We’ll start with a reviewing some modern
JavaScript techniques and React, the front-end framework we’ll be using
throughout the course.
<br>

### MODULE 2



#### The Full-Stack: Front-Ends & Back-Ends
<br>
<br>
Now that you’ve carved out the front end of your app, we’ll turn your project into a
fully-fledged full-stack application through the power of NodeJS. You’ll learn how
to build your first fully functional API using the server-side framework Express, and
how to manage the flow of data through HTTP requests and responses.
<br>

### MODULE 3
<br>


#### Storing & Persisting Data
<br>
<br>
We’ll continue to build out your application’s back end by learning about the
database ecosystem, and we’ll examine the differences between relational vs nonrelational
databases.
<br>

### MODULE 4
<br>


#### Intro to Models & Mongoose
<br>
Learn how to build predictable and re-usable data models through your application,
working with Mongoose to create schemas, validate types, and populate your
database with meaningful data.
<br>

### MODULE 5
<br>


#### Routing
<br>
We’ll learn about routing, and how it differs in the client and server-side
components of our application. We’ll look at ways we can refactor and augment
our server-side router, and implement client-side routes using React-Router.
<br>

### MODULE 6
<br>


#### Advanced Mongoose Querying & Back-End
<br>

##### Authentication
<br>
In this module, we’ll learn how to make advanced queries to our Mongo
Database through Mongoose. We’ll also learn how to add authentication to our
application using JWT - JSON Web Tokens.
<br>


### MODULE 7
<br>
<br>

#### Front-End Authentication
<br>
<br>
Now that we’ve successfully learned how to manage back-end authentication,
we’ll start to focus on how to create a user experience in our React app that
supports taking a signed in user through the journey of using our app, and
protecting routes against unauthorized users.
<br>


### MODULE 8
<br>


#### Back-End Security
<br>
<br>
In this module we’ll explore different techniques for securing our applications
with data validation and sanitization. We’ll also examine how to protect 3rdparty
API keys using environment variables.
<br>

### MODULE 9
<br>


#### Deploying Our Application
<br>
<br>
With our full-stack application ready to launch, you’ll learn how to deploy your
application onto the web so that others can start using it!
<br>


### MODULE 10
<br>
<br>
Final Project Presentations, Scaling our Application, & Beyond 
As we wrap up the course, we’ll talk about the reality of being a professional
application developer, how to make our applications scale, why testing is
important, and what the next steps are for your continued learning!
